This project is a simple static site generator script written in JavaScript (Node.js) that generates unique pages using data fetched from an API. The pages are generated using the EJS templating engine and are hosted on GitHub Pages. The main objectives of this project are:

1. Generate <100 unique pages dynamically.
2. Use a templating engine (EJS) to develop the UI.
3. Customize the UI using unique data from an API.
4. Host the generated pages on GitHub Pages.
